/// ⛔What this replaces asked the wrong question. The editing stack drew the
/// ACTIVE layer's tiles at [ui.FilterQuality.none] and every other layer at
/// [ui.FilterQuality.low], so *becoming* the active layer changed how a
/// layer was sampled: the artwork visibly changed every time the user
/// switched rows, and at a reduced zoom exactly one layer on screen was
/// aliased. 유저 2026-08-15: 「왜 비액티브레이어는 aa걸려있고 액티브레이어는

/// The law is one line because the answer never depended on the layer:
///
///  * **Magnified** (scale > 1) — the artist is looking at pixels, so show
///    pixels. Interpolating here invents detail the drawing does not have
///    and makes a hard 2치 edge mushy.
///  * **Reduced** (scale < 1) — more artwork pixels than screen pixels, so
///    point-sampling throws most of them away and the line work crawls and
///    shimmers. Filtering is what makes a reduced view honest.
///  * **1:1** — no resampling happens at all; `none` avoids a pointless
///    filter pass.
///
/// ⚠️This only MEANS anything if there is one resample to apply it to.
/// Applied per layer it would still be N resamples that merely agree with
/// each other; the composite buffer is what turns it into the law
/// ([[editing-canvas-composite-cache-program]] stage 2).
