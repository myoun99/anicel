/// signature with five or more parameters (constructors and copyWith
/// excluded), a body over sixty lines, a class over six hundred. The
/// numbers may only fall; a session that pushes one up reads the
/// offenders it added, and a session that brings one down lowers the
/// ceiling so the ratchet keeps its bite. ⛔Not a reason to split for
